Release Checklist
=================

This list is supposed to make sure we do not forget any important steps during
release.

1. Check and update issue tracker for issues associated with current milestone

2. Make sure all desired changes are part of the `dev` branch, or whichever branch is being staged for release

3. Push the branch with a `v*.*.*` style tag to the release branch, probably `moth`

5. GitHub Actions should create the changelog and the release

7. Announce the release
